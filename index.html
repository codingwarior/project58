        <p> Cooking has been interesting to me since I was young. There are so many varieties,flavours, condiments and combinations it looks like there is no limit to what you can make.<br> </br> There have been some favorites amongst my family when it comes to food like pizza,pasta,burgers all homemade from the pizza dough,to the pasta sauce. We do try and make some variations but these are our specialities.
            On a relaxing Sunday afternoon, the process begins. We start by rolling the dough a couple of times through the pasta machine so that it becomes very thin,but not so thin that it can come off easily. Then we cut the dough into many squares and fill a pumpkin and spinnich filling in the middle, folding it carefully, making sure the dough doesn't tear. After that we brush it in oil so that it is slippery and does not get stuck to the pan and then take it for cooking in a pan brushed with oil too. For flavor you may add olive oil or parmesean cheese if you want..</p>
